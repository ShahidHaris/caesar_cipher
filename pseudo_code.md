# There are two inputs, the string and the shift_count

# 1- create an empty array 
# 2- loop over each character of the string
    # check if the character is an uppercase
        # obtain the ascii code (DEC) of the charcter and push it into the empty array.
    # check if the charcter is a lowercase and do as previous
    # if the character is neither uppercase nor lowercase, then it has to be a special character. put it too inside the empty array.
# 3- turn the ascii code (DEC) stored in the empty array to characters
